# System Architecture

## Overview
DevOps Simulator follows a microservices architecture designed for high availability and scalability.  
This document covers both production and development configurations.  
Experimental (AI/ML-driven) architecture is under testing and documented below.

---

## Components

### 1. Application Server
- *Technology*: Node.js + Express
- *Production Port*: 8080
- *Development Port*: 3000
- *Scaling*: Horizontal auto-scaling (production only)
- *Development Features*: Hot reload, debug mode

<!--
# Experimental Enhancement:
- *Technology*: Node.js + Express + TensorFlow.js
- *Ports*: 9000 (main), 9001 (metrics), 9002 (AI API)
- *Scaling*: AI-powered predictive auto-scaling
- *Message Queue*: Apache Kafka for event streaming
-->

---

### 2. Database Layer
- *Database*: PostgreSQL 14
- *Production*: Master-slave replication with automated backups
- *Development*: Single local instance with seed data

<!--
# Experimental Database Layer:
- *Primary*: PostgreSQL cluster (5 nodes)
- *Cache*: Redis with ML-based cache optimization
- *Configuration*: Multi-master replication
- *Backup*: Continuous backup with geo-redundancy
- *AI Features*: Query optimization, index suggestions
-->

---

### 3. Monitoring System
- *Production*: Prometheus + Grafana with email alerts
- *Development*: Console logging with verbose output
- *Metrics*: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network

<!--
# Experimental Monitoring:
- *Metrics*: Prometheus + Thanos (long-term storage)
- *Logs*: ELK Stack + AI log analysis
- *AI Insights*: Predictive failure detection
-->

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Production
- *Method*: Rolling updates
- *Zero-downtime*: Yes
- *Rollback*: Automated on failure
- *Region*: us-east-1

### Development
- *Method*: Docker Compose
- *Features*: Hot reload, instant feedback
- *Testing*: Automated tests before deployment

<!--
# Experimental Deployment:
- *Multi-Cloud*: AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean
- *Orchestrator*: Kubernetes with AI-driven CRDs
- *Failover*: Cross-cloud automatic recovery
-->

---

## Security
- *Production*: SSL/TLS encryption, strict access controls
- *Development*: Relaxed security for easier debugging

<!--
# Experimental Security:
- *Zero Trust Architecture*
- *Encryption*: AES-256 with AI threat detection
-->
